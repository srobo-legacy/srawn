### Module 4 Announced to Competitors

Following [league session 3](https://studentrobotics.org/news/2021-03-20-sr2021-third-league-sessions/) which was held on 20th March, the [fourth and final game module (Module 4) was announced](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/resources/2021/rulebook.html).

This substantially changes the arena layout and adds new kinds of territories worth more game points. The towers also received an upgrade meaning they no longer become locked out, but if a robot attempts to claim a territory they already own then it will become unclaimed.

If you're interested in helping out with the final module and knockouts, come along to a competition meeting or get in touch.

### Social

We're planning on running some social events during early April. If you want to come along, just fill out the [doodle poll in Slack](studentrobotics.slack.com/archives/CF94T25GU/p1616619850002200). 

### Volunteer Mini-Competition

Now that we have the final module of the simulator developed we are wanting to try and do some smoke testing. If anyone is interested in putting together a robot and participating in a mini volunteer competition please reply to the [Slack thread](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/archives/C0EEJ0ASY/p1616619905004500)

## Competition

### Friendlies

We ran some friendly matches on Saturday 13th, they went well.

We're planning on running some more friendly matches for teams on the 3rd and 17th of April. These are a great chance to see how teams are fairing in the competition. They're very relaxed, and we mostly comment on how teams are performing in the matches. If you're interested in coming along or helping them happen, come along to a competition meeting, or join the calls when they're posted.

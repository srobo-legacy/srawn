# SR(A)WN 2015 — 12

This is the twelfth issue of the Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‐on across Student Robotics. **Emboldened** items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.

#### Internal Updates:

* Multiple [tech days happened][list-tech-day-dates], with [some interesting results][list-soton-tech-day]—no teams turned up at Southampton. Attendance has [started to be recorded][trac-tech-day-attendance] as a result of this.
* Student Robotics was [shown off at Southampton to prospective students][list-southampton-ucas].
* An [update on the charity situation][list-charity-update] was posted. The charity application has been submitted and there has been a large objection to this, leading to two committee members announcing that they will resign.
* Team QMC were [given a new power board][trac-qmc-power-board].
* Numerous purchasing tickets were closed. [^0]
* [Work on the tools continues][git-new-tools] and should be **[ready for public testing][trac-beta-dev-scripts]** shortly.
* Some of the **camera documentation has been [discovered to be wrong][trac-c270-bug]**.
* **Duplicate asset codes [were discovered][list-duplicate-asset-codes] in the inventory**.
* A decision on [how to proceed in terms of product searching][list-tools-product-searching] in the tools has **yet to be made**.
* An [update on team account creation][list-account-creation-update] was posted.
* An issue in the power board relating to I<sup>2</sup>C [has been fixed][list-power-board-i2c-fix].
* Output current reading measurements [have been taken][list-power-board-measurements].
* An [update to the rules][gerrit-rule-book-fix] fixing references to SR2014 [has been uploaded][gerrit-rule-book-upload].

#### Team Updates:

* HRS have been [experiencing problems][forum-hrs-current-limit] with the current limit on the power board.
* HRS may have a [problem with their camera][trac-hrs-camera]. They discovered that they [could not take photos at certain resolutions][forum-hrs-camera-issues].
* CLY have been getting [a mysterious beeping noise][forum-cly-beeping-noise].

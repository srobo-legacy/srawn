## March Virtual Tech Day
We're throwing a virtual tech day on the [5th March](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2022/virtual-tech-day-march/) on our Discord. This will give us the chance to provide some direct help to teams who may need it, and answer questions anyone may have. **If you're interested in helping mentor a team during the tech day, you can sign up to Discord using the links pinned in [#general](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/archives/C0EEJ0ASY) in Slack.**

## March Volunteer Social
There will be a social on Sunday 13th from 7:30pm onwards UK Time! This is a chance for volunteers to get together and unwind while playing some games. For full details **check out [#social](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/archives/CF94T25GU) in Slack**.

### Kit Packing Event - Next Weekend

There's a kit packing day happening on 2021-10-16 (next Saturday) at Southampton University (Building 32 (32/3077)). Plan is to start at around 10am.

Kit packing is when we test the kit works, clean it, triage it and pack it into RUBs to be shipped out to teams. It'll be a great chance to meet other volunteers and generally socialise. We'll probably then do something social in the evening too. 

All volunteers welcome, although we do strongly recommend doing a COVID test before attending. There's a [calendar event](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/month/2021/10/16?eid=N2hmdmF0Mmhlc3E5b3NtdmkzMTA4M2VwcmYgc3R1ZGVudHJvYm90aWNzLm9yZ19vcWRqYXN2cHBzOHNtbzBkNW50ZTQxN3Jha0Bn&ctz=Europe/London&sf=true) with all the details.


### Kit Hack Day - 30th October

There's a kit "hack" day happening on 2021-10-30  at Southampton University (Building 32 (32/3077)). We're planning to start at around 10am.

Kit hacking days are a chance for us to spend a day working on all aspects of the kit, making sure it's ready for kickstart. Not only is there development, but documentation, testing, chatting, discussions, and more. It'll be a great chance to meet other volunteers and generally socialise. We'll probably then do something social in the evening too.

All volunteers welcome, although we do strongly recommend doing a COVID test before attending. There's a [calendar event](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/month/2021/10/30?eid=MDlpbnU3N29kZWxtcHJvaDZqOTM4aWIzdGsgc3R1ZGVudHJvYm90aWNzLm9yZ19vcWRqYXN2cHBzOHNtbzBkNW50ZTQxN3Jha0Bn&ctz=Europe/London&sf=true) with all the details.

The Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter is a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‚Äêon across Student Robotics. **Emboldened** items are ones for which additional help has been requested.

### Sign up to help with our Kickstart team visits

We're running Kickstart a little differently this year. The [Kickstart](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2022/kickstart/?utm_source=srawn&utm_medium=srawn&utm_campaign=kickstart-recruitment) event will be livestreamed to all teams on Saturday 13th November 2021.

We would like to run one-on-one sessions to check the kits are in working order, assist with micro-games, and be there to answer any questions from the team. Some of these will be on the day, and some in the following few weeks, both virtually and in-person depending on team and volunteer availability.

**If you'd like to give our teams a head start and get involved with these sessions, please [sign up and let us know your availability](https://forms.gle/2ZUg8YL6Wv1yR5wj6)!**

## Successful Kit Packing Event

The kit packing event on the 16th and 17th October was a success and we had a great time getting things ready to send out to teams this year.

## Hack Day on 30th October

**There's a kit "hack" day happening on 2021-10-30 in Southampton university (building 32 (32/3077))**. Plan is to start at around 10. Kit hacking days are a chance for us to spend a day working on all aspects of the kit, making sure it's ready for kickstart. Not only is there development, but documentation, testing, chatting, discussions, and more. It'll be a great chance to meet other volunteers and generally socialise. We'll probably then do something social in the evening too. All volunteers are welcome, although we do strongly recommend doing a COVID test before attending. There's a calendar event on the shared SR calendar with all the details.

## Kit Logistics Issue Tracking proposal

A proposal was made in the last kit team meeting for tracking kit logistics for SR2022 and going forward in an open manner. It will allow us to have a view of what kits are currently in the field, and whether they need returning. The proposed ticketing-style system would be implemented using [GitHub Issue Templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms) and would replace the current system of spreadsheets.

More details are available in the [minutes from the meeting](https://github.com/srobo/kit-team-minutes/blob/main/2021/2021-10-19.md#kit-tracking-proposal-for-sr2022)

## Request for Help: Yocto and OpenEmbedded Experience

**Please could any volunteers willing to help out with embedded Linux on the ODROID reach out to the Kit Team in [#kit-software](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/archives/C012NKR0N5C) on Slack?.** We are aiming to reduce the size of the image and introduce atomic updates using Yocto / OpenEmbedded and would appreciate any time that volunteers with experience can spare! Currently both [Rauc](https://rauc.io/) and [Mender](https://mender.io/) are under consideration as alternatives to the [current Arch Linux based images](https://github.com/srobo/robot-image) we have been building.

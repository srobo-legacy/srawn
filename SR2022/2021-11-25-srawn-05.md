## SR2022 Kickstart a success

The SR2022 competition year was kicked off with our Kickstart event which was livestreamed to competitors on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/StudentRobotics)! You can find out more about the event as well as a summary of this years game in our [companion blog post](https://studentrobotics.org/blog/2021-11-15-sr2022-kickstart-and-rules/)

## Mentoring Teams

We're starting to organise mentoring for this year. **If you are interested in helping out a team with their robot, software, or strategy, please [fill in this form](https://forms.gle/j9DGoHv3qumBLCTa7)** and we'll try and match you with a team.

## Tech Days

We're throwing a virtual tech day on the 4th December on our Discord. This will give use the chance to provide some direct help to teams who may need it, and answer questions anyone may have. You can sign up to Discord using the links in [Slack](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/archives/C0EEJ0ASY).

We're starting to think about what in-person tech days might look like for 2022. **If you're interested in helping organise them or the rest of the competition event, come join a [competition team meeting](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=studentrobotics.org_oqdjasvpps8smo0d5nte417rak%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon)!**

## New Kit Software

With the start of this year's competition cycle, we have shipped our new [Yocto](https://yoctoproject.org)-based ODROID operating system.

The image runs our new [j5](https://github.com/j5api/j5)-based API, [sr.robot3](https://github.com/srobo/sr.robot3), [new vision system](https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/zoloto) and our [new robot management system](https://github.com/srobo/astoria) (replacing Herdsman). All included Python software on the runs on Python 3.9.

All our [kit downloads](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/kit/brain_board/updates) are being served using a Raspberry Pi from our sponsor [Mythic Beasts](https://www.mythic-beasts.com/). That's pretty cool!

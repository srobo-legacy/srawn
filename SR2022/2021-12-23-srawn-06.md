The Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter is a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‚Äêon across Student Robotics. **Emboldened** items are ones for which additional help has been requested.

## Festive Social

There will be a social on Wednesday 29th from 5pm onwards UK Time! This is a chance for volunteers to get together and unwind while playing some games. For full details check out the [#social](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/archives/CF94T25GU) channel in Slack.

## January Virtual Tech Day

We're throwing a virtual tech day on the [22nd January](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2022/virtual-tech-day-january/) on our Discord. This will give us the chance to provide some direct help to teams who may need it, and answer questions anyone may have. You can sign up to Discord using the links in Slack. If you're interested in helping mentor a team during the tech day, or want to help organise it, come along to a [competition meeting](https://studentrobotics.org/runbook/volunteering/calendars/)!

## Happy Holidays!

All of our Teams have been working hard over the past few months and most are winding down a little for a well deserved rest over the holiday period. They'll be back to full swing in the new year so if you want to get involved feel free to come along to a [meeting](https://studentrobotics.org/runbook/volunteering/calendars/).

Happy Holidays to all our SR volunteers!

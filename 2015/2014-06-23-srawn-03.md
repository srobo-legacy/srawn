# SR(A)WN 2015 â€” 3

This is the third issue of the Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings-on across SR. This is a bit of an experiment, so if you have feedback or think we've missed something, feel free to reply to this thread. **Emboldened items** are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.

 * Since exams are now over, Peter has resumed his ["Learning by doings"][0] idea, using Google Hangouts to perform tasks along with other blueshirts. **Ideas for topics of these doings would be welcome**. \[0\]
 * Peter has created [Trac pages][1] about the new competition software (that was used at the 2014 competition). \[1\]
 * Our treasurers sent out the cheques covering SR2014 expenses went to volunteers and teams recently.
 * Certificates were organised and sent out by Howard.
 * [Participant stats][2] for SR2014 were added to Trac by Rob. \[2\]
 * Jon Bartlett is finalising the [child protection policy-related documents][3]. \[3\]
 * Murray has posted the results of last weeks doing, [reviews of the current game ideas][4]. \[4\]
 * Alistair has been working on [revising the regulations][5] in the game rules to condense them down and make them clearer. \[5\]
 * Merging competition and development robot modes was briefly discussed and the conclusion was that the modes will be kept separate. The discussion, however, has led to the creation of a [Trac page][6]. \[6\]
 * Andy Busse has requested that [**volunteers who are interesting in taking part in the summer school should contact him**][7]. \[7\]
 * Rob is making progress on the [charity situation][8]. \[8\]
 * Comments that various people have made about the 2014 competition have been collated into a [Trac page][9]. \[9\]

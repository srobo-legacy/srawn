# SR(A)WN 2015 — 15

This is the fifteenth issue of the Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‐on across Student Robotics. **Emboldened** items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.

### Internal Updates

- A hangout to discuss the competition software occured, with various outcomes. Tickets have been created and anyone can feel free to pick up any task. Already bugs and features are being submitted to Gerrit and merged in.
- Bristol hosted its second tech day—33 competitors turned up.
- Part of the 'How to Help' page on the website has been rewritten to make it more readable.
- Steering committee vote happened and the results have been published.
- A discussion tinker time at the competition has been initiated and is on going.
- Funding has been received from Motorola.
- The _first_ Volunteer Activity Day happened and was a great success.
- Investigations into whether keeping Git objects in a database is any better for the IDE.
- Research into improved match scheduling at the competition has happened.
- A private PyPI has been set up to putu any Pip and Setuptools based Python projects we have.
- A commit to merge the new tools branch back into the tools has been submitted to Gerrit.

# SR(A)WN 2015 — 20

This is the twentieth issue of the Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‐on across Student Robotics. **Emboldened** items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.

It's only **3** days until the competition! Everyone volunteering at the competition should have received their role assignment and hotel/travel information.

### Internal Updates

- Flags [were built][trac-build-flags] in Southampton. Adornments have also been bought and will be transported to the competition.
- Everything from Southampton has gone up to Newbury in preparation for the competition.
- Robot markers [have been updated][trac-update-markers] for this year's competition.
- A number of SRComp and SRWeb related patches have been submitted and merged improving the website throughout the competition.

### Team Updates

- A number of teams have unfortunately dropped out, putting the total number of drop outs at 10 currently.

We look forward to seeing many of you at the competition this weekend.

Thanks to everyone who helped put this issue together. If you would like, you can also read the [previous issue][list-previous-issue].

# SR(A)WN 2015 â€” 4

This is the fourth issue of the Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings-on across SR. This is a bit of an experiment, so if you have feedback or think we've missed something, feel free to reply to this thread. **Emboldened** items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.

 - Two internships are running over the summer. Giorgos Karatziolas will be working on [making a battery fuel guage][giorgos-internship] [0] and Tom Leese will be working on the interface on the tablets as part of the new SR2015 kit (list post to come shortly).
 - Certificates have *definitely* [been sent out now][certificates-sent-out] [1].
 - The game submission deadline is almost with us: [discussion ends on the 4th and voting on the 9th][game-submission-deadline] [2]. **Anyone who has a game submission should take the time to [clarify the final version][clarify-final-game] [3] of their game on the list.**
 - Smallpeice is taking place in the last week of July and **any extra volunteers would be helpful**.
 - The steering minutes from the latest committee meeting (23rd July) [have been placed into Git][steering-minutes] [4]. Key points to take away include: aiming for 81 teams and schools like the idea of having to travel to get to a kickstart to encourage the students.
 - Signing up exists in some form or other, and [discussion is ongoing][signup-discussion] [5].
 - Jeremy has posted the [teacher feedback he has received][teacher-feedback] [6], and that feedback is generally very good.
 - Sam has performed some analysis on the competition server logs and performed some extra benchmarking to [produce a report][competition-server-report] [7].
 - Jeremy has reported that a line of code with [17,000 characters causes pylint 0.26 to hang][pylint-hang] [8], solutions include enforcing a line-length limit or simply updating pylint.

Thanks to Lilafisch, Tyler Ward and Tom Leese for contributing. The previous issue can be found [here][previous-issue] [9].

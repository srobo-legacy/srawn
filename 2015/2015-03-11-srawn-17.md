# SR(A)WN 2015 — 17

This is the seventeenth issue of the Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‐on across Student Robotics. **Emboldened** items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.

It's only **45** days until the competition!

### Internal Updates

- The volunteer form for the competition [has been released][list-volunteer-form]. If you would like to come to the competition, **please fill out the [volunteer sign up form][external-volunteer-form]**.
- Various fixes and improvements to SRComp [have occurred][trac-srcomp-tickets]. A dry run/test day will be happening later this month and if you would like to have your voice heard on what date it happens, **please fill out the [SRComp Dry Run doodle poll][external-srcomp-dry-run-doodle]**.
- After some flags were created in Southampton, pictures of them [have been placed on Trac][trac-2015-flags].

### Team Updates

- Uppingham School (*UPP*) are experiencing some [servo board connection problems][forum-upp-servo-board].

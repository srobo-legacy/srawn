# SR(A)WN 2015 — 14

This is the fourteenth issue of the Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‐on across Student Robotics. **Emboldened** items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.

### Internal updates:

- Mentoring in Southampton [has started][trac-southampton-mentoring], a bit later than usually though.
- The first Tech Day in Munich happened at MAI, who have built an arena for testing.
- Competition Software now runs on [Python 3][gerrit-srcomp-python3] and [uses Setuptools][gerrit-srcomp-setuptools] for installation.
- SRBot has [been replaced][gerrit-willie] by [Willie][willie].
- Sign-ups for a committee position [have now closed][list-committee-vote].
- [Various updates][list-southampton-venue] to Southampton venue ideas for the competition have happened.
- There is a [date hold on Newbury Racecourse][list-newbury-date-hold] as a competition venue.
- The _first_ Volunteer Activity Day is [happening this week][list-activity-date].
- A summary of the possible results from the committee vote has [been posted][list-committee-vote-summary].

- Bishop Wordsworth School have not assembled a robot, but they have started programming.
- South Wilts Grammar School have a robot base with wheels and lots of code.

First time mentor, Andy Barrett-Sprot, says "I expected it to be more like teaching, but it was more about supporting the teams, I think that's a good idea because it doesn't waste their time.".

Thanks to Tom Leese, Alistair Lynn, Lilafisch and Murray Colpman for working on this issue. The previous issue can be found [here][list-previous-issue].

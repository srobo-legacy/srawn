- George Field has created a [token/arena cheatsheet][token-arena-cheatsheet] to help competitors.
- The [date for the activity day has been announced as the 13th February][list-activity-day].
- An [email about the London tech day has been sent out to teams][gerrit-london-tech-day], and as a consequence to this, there has already been two sign-ups for the tech day in Southampton.

Thanks to everyone who helped put this issue together.

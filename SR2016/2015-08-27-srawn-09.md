# SR(A)WN 2016 — 9

This is the ninth issue of the 2016 Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‐on across Student Robotics. **Emboldened** items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.

- Student Robotics has been [successfully registered as a charity][list-charity].
- There is a possibility of some media opportunities happening with the BBC in the near future and **[any related media items are being collated][list-media]**.

One month to go until the competition!

- Jeremy has [requested help dealing with media consent forms][list-mcf]. He may have enough volunteers now although if you are up for it, it would be good to let him know.

- Some [reflection on the well-received tech day that happened in Southampton][list-techday] on the 19th March has been posted.

- [Discussion on how mock arenas could be built][list-mockarena] in the future has been started.

Thanks to everyone who helped put this issue together. .

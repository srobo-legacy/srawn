# SR(A)WN 2016 — 7

This is the seventh issue of the 2016 Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‐on across Student Robotics. **Emboldened** items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.

- The [participant stats][trac-participant-stats] have been updated to include details on SR2015.
- A ‘Computing and Microelectronics’ course run by the [Smallpeice Trust][smallpeice] and utilising Student Robotics kit is under way this week.

- An [interactive 3D token website][token-website] has been created.
- Kickstart happened and was very successful! Thanks go to everyone who helped and we hope you enjoyed the day.
- There are plans for an activity day in place and we're looking for [people to submit what day they would like best][activity-day-poll].
- There [was a bug in the naming of the markers in the robot code][list-bug] which has been fixed and shipped.


Thanks to everyone who helped put this issue together.

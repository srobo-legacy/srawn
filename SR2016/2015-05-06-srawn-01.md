# SR(A)WN 2016 — 1

This is the first issue of the 2016 Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‐on across Student Robotics. **Emboldened** items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.

### Updates

- The 2015 competition happened and it was awesome, [congratulations go to the winners][srweb-comp-news] and thanks to all the volunteers who helped out on the day—we hope to see you next year! Photos of the competition [are being posted][list-comp-photos] to [Flickr][flickr-comp].
- A number of volunteers [have posted their opinions][list-comp-retrospective] of how this year’s competition went.
- A “News & Events” mailing list [has been created][list-news-events] to coincide with the first fortnightly newsletter of the 2016 year. The mailing list will contain information regarding upcoming events and related news which I would recommend any volunteer [subscribe to][list-srobo-news].
- Various updates to the tools have [been merged][list-tools-merged]. Changes include support for Python 3, virtual environments and a new ‘sr inv-history’ tool.

Thanks to everyone who helped put this issue together. If you would like, you can also read the [previous issue][list-previous-issue].

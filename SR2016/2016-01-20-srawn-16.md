Apologies for the delay from the last newsletter, the Christmas break combined with exams has given us a break without reconvening

- Christmas and new year happened!
- Mentors have been allocated in Southampton, and will start mentoring their teams soon!
- The Student Robotics Volunteer activity day 2016 has been announced, and there is a [doodle poll][doodle-poll] to find the most convenient date.

Thanks to everyone who helped put this issue together.

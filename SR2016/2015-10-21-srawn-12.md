# SR(A)WN 2016 — 12

**17 days to Kickstart!**

[Future is now!][future]

This is the twelfth issue of the 2016 Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‐on across Student Robotics. **Emboldened** items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.

- The organisation structure for Kickstart [has been announced][list-kickstart-structure] and all assets have been transferred to the charity.
- Power boards and batteries have been taken to Oxford for testing.
- A `beep` function [has been added to the power board Python API][gerrit-beep].
- An outline has been put together for the Kickstart microgames.

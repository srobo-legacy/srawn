**17 days to Kickstart!**

[Future is now!][future]

- The organisation structure for Kickstart [has been announced][list-kickstart-structure] and all assets have been transferred to the charity.
- Power boards and batteries have been taken to Oxford for testing.
- A `beep` function [has been added to the power board Python API][gerrit-beep].
- An outline has been put together for the Kickstart microgames.

Thanks to everyone who helped put this issue together.

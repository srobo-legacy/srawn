## SR2023 Competition Dates Announced

The SR2023 competition will be held on the weekend of the 1st and 2nd of April 2023. We're working hard on confirming the venue but hope that you can at least mark the date in your calendars!

## Kit Update 2023.1.0 + Upcoming Release

We shipped an update to the Kit Software üéâ Version 2023.1.0 has a number of improvements, including the necessary changes for the reduced marker size in the last rules update. You can read about them in our [announcement post](https://studentrobotics.org/blog/2022-12-01-kit-os-2023.1.0/).

The Kit team is planning to release a kit software update after the new year on 2023-01-07. If you have any ideas for software improvements that could be implemented before them, let us know in [#kit-software](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/archives/C012NKR0N5C) on Slack.

## December Virtual Tech Day

Unfortunately due to circumstances outside of our control, we had to pivot the December Tech Day to be virtual. We instead held it on our [Discord](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/team_admin/discord) server with volunteers on hand to help with any issues or problems the competitors had.

## December Social

We had a volunteer social on Saturday 10th December. It was a lot of fun with chatting and some casual party/group games. Keep an eye on [#social](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/archives/CF94T25GU) in Slack to see the planning for our next one. All volunteers are most welcome :)

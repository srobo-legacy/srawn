## SR2024 Kit Roadmap Ideas

If you have ideas for features or changes to the kit for SR2024 (or even SR2025!), we are gathering them in a document. We will announce a meeting to discuss all of the ideas soon. **Please [add your ideas to our ideas doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPeSuchNcsNS6P1QKz0Catd80kKYswcYzVnj0VsMaCo/edit?usp=sharing).**

All volunteers are welcome to suggest ideas and all ideas are welcome!

## December Tech Day

We are running a [Tech Day](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2023/london-tech-day-december/) on the 3rd of December in Whitechapel, London. Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their robot with lots of help available. **If you're interested in helping out please post in the [Slack thread](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/archives/CDCJ93YMC/p1668717579317229).**

## Mentoring Teams

A huge thank you to everyone who has signed up to be a mentor so far! We're still looking for more people who would like to be assigned to a team and join their meetings on a regular basis to provide support and ideas. If you're interested in this please **[sign up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lNGjfSpTzXeQRxv0WDn3X8mL_kBJWcwb69zNNZm08KU/edit) to become a mentor**.

## CRM for managing Competitor Teams

The Infrastructure Team are exploring a [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) or similar off-the-shelf tool could help manage interactions with competitor teams. **Suggestions for approaches are welcome** (please post in [#infrastructure in slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T0EEPF1LH/C02BXUAK33M)).

## Rules Update

The Competition Team have published an update to the rules which changes the sizes of token markers and of the Bronze and Silver tokens, such that the markers (and importantly their white borders) will actually fit on the tokens. Markers are now 80mm and these smaller tokens are 130mm.

## Documentation Platform

The Infrastructure Team are exploring improvements to our internal documentation platform and will be seeking input from the various Teams & Committees soon. In the meanwhile the review requirements on the runbook have been considerably relaxed to make contributions easier.

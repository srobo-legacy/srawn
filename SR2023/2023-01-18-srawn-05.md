## Kit Team Plans for SR2024

The Kit Team held a meeting to refine their plans for SR2024. With a backlog of items to workthrough **if you'd like to help please post in [#kit-team](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/archives/CMQ49PXPG) on Slack.**

## Mentoring

We're looking for volunteers to mentor our SR2023 teams. This is a great opportunity (especially for new volunteers) to actively get involved with competitors, see their design process, and learn about our kit. This involves joining their meetings on a regular basis to provide support and ideas. If you're interested in this please **[sign up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lNGjfSpTzXeQRxv0WDn3X8mL_kBJWcwb69zNNZm08KU/edit) to become a mentor**.

## Infrastructure Team

The Infrastructure team have a few projects underway:

- Planning the infrastructure for the competition
- Investigating a CRM for teams & volunteers
- Collecting information from internal teams about iterating our internal documentation platform

If you'd like to help with any of these **(please post in [#infrastructure in slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T0EEPF1LH/C02BXUAK33M)).**

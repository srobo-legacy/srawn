## Kit Packing Event

We have a kit packing event coming up on Saturday the 5th of Novemeber in Southampton. Help would be appreciated. **Please post in [#kit-team](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/archives/CMQ49PXPG) on Slack if you want to help out.**

## SR2023 Kickstart

On Saturday 22nd October we had our Kickstart event held in-person at Southampton University and virtually via a [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVnNv5GSpyQ) on our YouTube channel. We're incredibly grateful to everyone who worked hard to make the event a success, and it was fantastic to see so many new volunteers join us.

## Kickstart Retro

Now that Kickstart has happened we're arranging a meeting to discuss what went well and what we may need to change in the future. This "retrospective" will be held on Wednesday 2nd November 8pm UK Time after the regular Competition Team meeting in the [same Google Meet call](https://meet.google.com/bzu-aacz-jbh). All are welcome, but **we'd particularly like to encourage those that attended the event to attend!**

## Mentoring Teams

Now that SR2023 is underway we're looking at how we can support our teams. One way we do this is through mentoring, where we assign a volunteer to a team and they join their meetings on a regular basis to provide support and ideas. If you're interested in this please **[sign up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lNGjfSpTzXeQRxv0WDn3X8mL_kBJWcwb69zNNZm08KU/edit) to become a mentor**.

## Blog Posts

The Marketing team are looking for various blog posts to publish throughout the competition year. These could be of a technical nature, related to careers, STEM education, or about anything else SR! We're more than happy to help develop ideas and assist with writing and editing these, so do please **reach out to us in [#marketing](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/archives/C02C3LDGFP0) on Slack if you are interested.**

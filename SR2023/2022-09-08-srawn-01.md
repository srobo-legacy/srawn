The Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter is a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‚Äêon across Student Robotics. **Emboldened** items are ones for which additional help has been requested.

## The SR kit is getting an upgrade!

This year's kit will be using Raspberry Pis instead of the previously used ODROID brain boards. We've also designed, and manufactured new Pi Hats (known as the [KCH](https://github.com/srobo/kch-hw)) as part of the kit revamp.

## SR2023 Planning Underway

Work is underway on planning kickstart, and the signups for teams have opened. **Please keep an eye on [#competition-team](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/archives/CBP7UL6RG) and SR(A)WN over the next few weeks to see how you can help.**

## New hosting provider

We've moved the website hosting to Mythic Beasts. This means that https://srobo.org/ works again, plus we have IPv6 and HTTP/2 support now.

## Less typos inbound

We're in the process of adding spell checking to our repos, which should reduce the typos that make it to the outside world.

## Infrastructure Team Roadmap

The Infrastructure Team are in the process of creating a roadmap of work for the next 6 months or so. **If you have any ideas for what you think they should work on please post in [#infrastructure](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/archives/C02BXUAK33M)**

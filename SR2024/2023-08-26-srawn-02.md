The Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter is a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‚Äêon across Student Robotics. **Emboldened** items are ones for which additional help has been requested.

## Kit testing and packing socials

The dates for kit testing and packing social are the 2nd and 16th September. No technical experience is required, nor is experience with the kit. Just a willingness to get involved and an appetite to learn. Locations will be announced soon, but **if you're interested in attending, RSVP to the calendar event or keep an eye on Slack.**

## Kickstart is virtual this year!

[Kickstart SR2024](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2024/virtual-kickstart/) will be held virtually with teams tuning in to our [YouTube livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQeEEVy9zvM) from their schools. We'll be supporting teams in Discord so **if you want to get involved with mentoring please reach out in [#competition-team](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/archives/CBP7UL6RG) on Slack!**

## Competitor Team sign-ups are open!

We've already have ~25 teams expressing their interest, but there's still time for teams to sign-up. **If you know an institution that would like to enter a team, encourage them to fill out [the sign-up form on our website](https://studentrobotics.org/compete/)**

The Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter is a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‚Äêon across Student Robotics. **Emboldened** items are ones for which additional help has been requested.

## Kit cleaning a success, packing next!

A couple weeks ago, volunteers assembled in Southampton to perform maintenance on the kits. Kits were tested, cleaned, updated and organised for next year. It was an incredibly productive event, so thanks you everyone who made it possible.

We do need to finish off the cleaning and testing of the kit, and start packing it into boxes ready to be shipped to teams. No technical experience is required, nor is experience with the kit. Just a willingness to get involved and an appetite to learn. **If you're interested in helping out, complete [this poll](https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/dG8XB30e) by 1st August.**

## Help get the Simulator ready for Kickstart

We're starting up a Special Interest Group (SIG) for getting the SR robot simulator ready for kickstart! **If you're interested in getting involved, react to [the thread in Slack](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/archives/C0EEJ0ASY/p1689611975565779).**

## Help plan the next iteration of our Kit

The kit team are considering what the next iteration of kit might look like, and are open to any and all suggestions and opinions for how it should work, feature-set and design. **A meeting has been scheduled for September 19th at 7:15, all volunteers are welcome.** More details can be found in [our calendar](https://studentrobotics.org/runbook/volunteering/calendars/).

## The Infrastructure Team is looking for volunteers

The infrastructure team are interested in new members. **If you'd like to help out running SR's internal tech infrastructure please post in #infrastructure in slack.**
The infrastructure team currently meets on Wednesday evenings once a month, however this time is under review to ensure it works well for all team members.

## Kit firmware rewritten

The kit team recently undertook the mammoth task of rewriting the firmware on the motor and power boards, to both expose more features, improve maintainability and ease of use. The new firmware will ship in SR2024, to go alongside the updated power board firmware we shipped in SR2023. The [power](https://github.com/srobo/power-v4-fw), [servo](https://github.com/srobo/servo-v4-fw) and [motor](https://github.com/srobo/motor-v4-fw) firmwares are all available on our GitHub. A massive thanks to Will Barber for his huge contributions to this effort.

## New Committees

The internal Student Robotics Teams now have new committees. A huge thank you to all those who were apart of the outgoing committees! They have done a great job at steering the work of their respective teams over the last committee cycle(s) and we hope that they will look back with pride at everything they achieved.

Your new committees are:

- Competition Team - Andy Busse, Andrew Barrett-Sprot, and Alistair Lynn.
- Kit Team - Jake Howard, Josh Perriman, and Karina Kwiatek.
- Infrastructure Team - Peter Law.
- Marketing Team - Hope Shaw and James Seden Smith
- Volunteer Onboarding Team - Antoine Petty and Alex Colville

The Fundraising Team committee has yet to be finalised, the trustees are currently talking to a couple of people and will confirm in due course.

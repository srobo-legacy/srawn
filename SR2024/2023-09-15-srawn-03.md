## Upcoming Kit Packing Event

On the 16th September is the final kit packing event. Here we'll be sorting out the final pieces of kit, ensuring all the software is up-to-date, and packing it into boxes. It's happening at the University of Southampton in Building 32. **All volunteers welcome, and no kit experience required.**

## SR2024 Kickstart

Kickstart is coming up soon, and whilst it's a virtual even there's still a lot to be done. If you're interested in helping out, keep an eye on `#competition-team` in Slack or come along to a competition meeting. Team management, rules writing, venue booking, microgames design - plenty to do!

## V5 kit kick-off meeting

The kick-off meeting for the V5 iteration of kit has been **postponed to 3rd October at 19:15 (UK time)**. If you're interested in getting involved with what the new vision for our kit is, please come along - everyone is welcome. This meeting will be very high level, talking about what a new kit might look like, form factor, features, design etc. The meeting link can be found in [our calendar](https://studentrobotics.org/runbook/volunteering/calendars/)

## Documentation Overhaul

A huge effort is underway to update our docs and ensure everything is correct and as approachable as possible for the students. **If you're interested in helping out, take a look at the open [PRs](https://github.com/srobo/docs/pulls) or [issues](https://github.com/srobo/docs/issues), or contact the kit team.**

## The Game

The SR2024 game has been decided and efforts are underway to write up the rulebook for competitors. A huge thanks to all the volunteers on the Game Special Interest Group who came up with 4 fantastic proposals for us to choose from!

## Kit Cleaning Event a Success!

There was a kit event on Saturday the 2nd to get the kit finalised and ready to be packed into kits. It was a successful and productive event, so thanks to everyone involved.

## V5 Kit Development Now Underway

We kicked off the V5 Kit development with a very successful brainstorming meeting identifying the impacted parties and what they might care about from a kit. The Kit Team / Committee are going to schedule in some regular, more narrow-focused meetings to discuss some of these areas. If you're interested in helping out, keep an eye on SR(A)WN and [#kit-team](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/archives/CMQ49PXPG) / [#v5-kit](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/archives/C05UKL9J615) in Slack for updates.

## SR2024 Teams Confirmed

We’ve confirmed the teams for SR2024 and have now closed sign-ups. A huge thanks to all on the Competition and Kit teams for their work in collating Kit shipping information.

## SR2024 Kits have been shipped

The bulk of the kits have now been shipped to teams well in time for them to arrive prior to Kickstart. A huge thanks to the Kit and Competition Teams for their hard work in confirming details with our teams.

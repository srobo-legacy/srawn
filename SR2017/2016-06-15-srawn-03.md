# SR(A)WN 2017 -- 3

This is the third issue of the 2017 Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‚Äêon across Student Robotics. **Emboldened** items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.

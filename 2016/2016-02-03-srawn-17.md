# SR(A)WN 2016 — 17

This is the seventeenth issue of the 2016 Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‐on across Student Robotics. **Emboldened** items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.

- George Field has created a [token/arena cheatsheet][token-arena-cheatsheet] to help competitors.
- The [date for the activity day has been announced as the 13th February][list-activity-day].
- An [email about the London tech day has been sent out to teams][gerrit-london-tech-day], and as a consequence to this, there has already been two sign-ups for the tech day in Southampton.

Thanks to everyone who helped put this issue together. If you would like, you can also read the [previous issue][list-previous-issue].

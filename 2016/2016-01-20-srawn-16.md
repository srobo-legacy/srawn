# SR(A)WN 2016 — 16

This is the sixteenth issue of the 2016 Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‐on across Student Robotics. **Emboldened** items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.

Apologies for the delay from the last newsletter, the Christmas break combined with exams has given us a break without reconvening

- Christmas and new year happened!
- Mentors have been allocated in Southampton, and will start mentoring their teams soon!
- The Student Robotics Volunteer activity day 2016 has been announced, and there is a [doodle poll][doodle-poll] to find the most convenient date.

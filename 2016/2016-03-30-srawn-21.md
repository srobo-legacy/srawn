# SR(A)WN 2016 — 21

This is the twenty first issue of the 2016 Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‐on across Student Robotics. **Emboldened** items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.

One month to go until the competition!

- Jeremy has [requested help dealing with media consent forms][list-mcf]. He may have enough volunteers now although if you are up for it, it would be good to let him know.

- Some [reflection on the well-received tech day that happened in Southampton][list-techday] on the 19th March has been posted.

- [Discussion on how mock arenas could be built][list-mockarena] in the future has been started.

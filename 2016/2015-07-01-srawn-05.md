# SR(A)WN 2016 — 5

This is the fifth issue of the 2016 Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‐on across Student Robotics. **Emboldened** items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.

- The community [has voted for Student Robotics becoming a charity][list-charity-result].
- Elections [are open for the position of Public Interaction][list-elections-open] in the steering committee.
- [Work on the volunteer handbook has continued][list-volunteer-handbook] and **would appreciated receiving reviews**.

# SR(A)WN 2016 — 2

This is the second issue of the 2016 Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‐on across Student Robotics. **Emboldened** items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.

The typical lull *after* the storm that is the Student Robotics competition has lead to not an enormous amount happening over the last two weeks. Nevertheless...!

- If you have any remaining receipts from SR2015, [make sure you submit them by the 1<sup>st</sup> June][list-receipts] to ensure you get your money back.
- A ticket to start off some discussion about how we write documentation [**has been opened**][trac-docs].

# SR(A)WN 2016 — 20

This is the twentieth issue of the 2016 Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‐on across Student Robotics. **Emboldened** items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.

- The Southampton Branch has hosted an AGM today, the results of which [have been published in this blog post][list-agm].

- [Some discussion about whether robots can perform actions before start signal][list-robot-actions] has happened.

- [BDF would like some electronics help][list-bdf], **if you're in the Bedford area, it would be good to let us know**.

- Peter has started the ball rolling on both [the scoresheet design][list-scoresheet] and [the competition software for SR2016][list-comp-software], the latter of which he's given a deadline for modifications of the weekend of the 16th April.

# SR(A)WN â€” 11 (Tom's Birthday) (Happy birthday!)

This is the eleventh issue of the Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings-on across SR. If you have feedback or think we've missed something, feel free to reply to this thread. **Emboldened** items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.

* The Trac wiki was cleaned and brought up to date at a [recent Southampton doing][list-trac-cleanup].
* Python tools port [is still happening][list-tools-doing] and **[testing the new tools][wiki-tools-beta-installation] would be very helpful**.
* [Revision 2 of the rules][list-rules] has been shipped.
* Tech days have been [announced][site-keydates] for both Southampton and Bristol.
* srweb has been updated to use [Smarty 3][list-smarty].
* Alistair put together [a script to watch Gerrit and update trac tickets][autotrac] when they get fixed in commits following standard fix message convention.
* [Fritter][fritter] is now live and running in production. Written by Peter, it enables a large number of emails to be sent out without appearing as spam.
* An [improved Child Protection policy][child-protection] has been outlined and **desperately requires feedback**.
* The towel-throws mechanism is still under discussion on the srobo-game list. No resolution is forthcoming, **more input would be appreciated**.
* The steering committee will be meeting this December to discuss Student Robotics [becoming a charity][charity].
* The assembly of the Kit is now documented [in the Docs][docs] and an [assembly video][video].
* There is now a tool to generate Trac tickets for yearly [recurring tasks][recur]. This has now been used to generate the [Trac tickets for the 2015 competition][sr2015].
* We are starting to collect mentoring times for all the teams, which are documented on the [Teams page on Trac][trac-teams].

Team Updates:

* QMC [broke a power board][forum-qmc-power].
* There are 18 teams who have set their [team status][site-ts] on the website.
* CCR are [looking at using an I<sup>2</sup>C motor controller][forum-motor-board].

Thanks to Tom Leese, Giorgos Karatziolas, Freddie Nash, lilafisch, and Alistair Lynn for contributing. The previous issue can be found [here][trac-previous].

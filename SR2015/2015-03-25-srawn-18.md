# SR(A)WN 2015 — 18

This is the eighteenth issue of the Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‐on across Student Robotics. **Emboldened** items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.

It's only **31** days until the competition, make sure you've [signed up to volunteer][list-volunteer-survey]!

### Internal Updates

- Due to last minute ECS changes, the Southampton [Vault has been moved][list-vault-move] to a new location in the Level 4 Seminar Room in Mountbatten.
- The [layout for the competition has been decided][list-competition-layout], and it will basically be the same as last years.
- A comprehensive [page containing tasks suitable for beginners][trac-beginner-tasks] has been created.
- [Attendance has been updated][trac-attendance] after the Tech Days on the 14th March.

Thanks to everyone who helped put this issue together. If you would like, you can also read the [previous issue][list-previous-issue].

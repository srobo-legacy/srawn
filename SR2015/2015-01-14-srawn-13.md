# SR(A)WN 2015 — 13

This is the thirteenth issue of the Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‐on across Student Robotics. **Emboldened** items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.

### Internal updates:

 * Committee steering elections are coming up. **Applicants for roles must do so via [the mailing list][steering-committee-vote] by 26th January.** Steering committee roles on Trac have been [updated][committee-roles].
 * [Various patches][gerrit-srweb-puppet] to `srweb` which move submodules to Puppet have been updated and require reviewing.
 * [Jekyll][jekyll-on-github] is being [worked on][jekyll-update].
 * [Further updates to the power board][list-power-board-updates] have been worked on.
 * Flag design and prototyping for SR2015 [has happened][list-flag-design].
 * The improvements to the tools have [reached feature completion][list-tools-update]. **People should upgrade to check their workflow hasn't been broken.**
 * [More responses][list-charity-situation] relating to charity objections have been posted.

### Team updates:

 * More teams have been [asking questions][forum-flag-mascot] about the mascots on the top of the flags.

# SR(A)WN 2015 — 16

This is the sixteenth issue of the Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‐on across Student Robotics. **Emboldened** items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.

### Internal Updates

- The competition dates have been [finalised][list-competition-date] and [announced][gerrit-competition-announcement]. It is happening on 25th and 26th April at Newbury Racecourse (set-up day on 24th).
- Tech Days in Southampton, Bristol, and Didcot/Oxford [have happened][trac-tech-day-attendance].
- Various issues with `SRComp` have been [fixed][trac-competition-software-tickets] and the updated version is [ready to be deployed][trac-srcomp-deployment].
- Some flags were created using facilities at Southampton for the Tech Days. Andy Barrett-Sprot and Freddie Nash are currently in the process of writing a manufacturing tutorial for them.
- Giorgos is [working on][piezo-tasks] getting the piezoelectric speaker in the power board controllable from user code.
- Murray is [working on][kiosk] a kiosk system to allow webpages to quickly be displayed on kiosks around the venue (including arena displays, league tables, etc.) and easily changed remotely.
- Peter [has (re?)surrected][lieutenants] the idea of having properly defined contacts for each branch.
- Tom and others [are working on] a handbook for volunteers, focusing on mentoring but also covering development. **Contact Tom off-list if you want to be involved.**

### Team Updates

- KDE have been given a replacement power board.
- RHY have dropped out.
- HRS's power board has been updated to the newer firmware to solve the current limit problem.

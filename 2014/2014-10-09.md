# SR(A)WN 2015 — 8

This is the eighth issue of the Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings-on across SR. If you have feedback or think we've missed something, feel free to reply to this thread. **Emboldened** items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.

 - [53 teams are now signed up][2015-teams] for the competition; two teams have unfortunately dropped out already.
 - Creation of accounts before Kickstart [has worked out well][2015-account-creation].
 - The server [has been moved][server-move] over to a more powerful Linode VPS called 'saffron' — Rob won a doughnut for correctly guessing the server naming scheme, which was Firefly!
 - A [discussion on electrical safety][electrical-safety-list] has been started on the list and progress will continue in a [trac ticket][electrical-safety-trac].
 - Student Robotics was [mentioned in a recently edition of The Daily Telegraph][daily-telegraph].
 - Bristol and Southampton held their Newbie Doings for this year:
   - *Southampton:* We had cake! To make entry to mentoring easier we are trying a new concept: assign personal tutor to newbie.
   - *Bristol:* Large turnout at the newbie Doing.
 - Peter [proposed a number of ways][publicity] to get better publicity, including organising the news better.
 - First cuts of the videos produced by Olly during Smallpeice are available at their respective trac tickets: [State Machines][videos-state-machines], [Inputs][videos-inputs], [Program Design][videos-program-design] and [Debugging][videos-debugging].
 - SR testing: Southampton spent the last doings developing [test scripts][test-scripts] for cameras, motor boards and ruggueduinos; these scripts are now all functioning and testing with them will finish soon.
 - Batteries are being tested and recharged ready for shipping.
 - Assembly of new boards into cases has started in Oxford.
 - Alistair, Giorgos and Lilafisch are getting the micro games finished and Giorgos will announce a doing for assembling the bits that need to go to the different Kickstarts, instructions for blueshirts are being written.
 - Chris K is making progress on the rules, **please help by reviewing**.
 - The [trac milestone for Kickstart][kickstart-milestone] is rather empty, **please help by filling in what is missing!**

Thanks to everyone who turned up at the doing yesterday for contributing (apologies for being unable to name people directly). The previous issue can be found [here][previous-issue].

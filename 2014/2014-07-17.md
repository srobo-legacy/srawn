# SR(A)WN 2015 â€” 5

This is the fifth issue of the Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings-on across SR. This is a bit of an experiment, so if you have feedback or think we've missed something, feel free to reply to this thread. **Emboldened** items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.
